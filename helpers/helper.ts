It moves swiftly and gracefully across the stars, leaving a brief trail of glowing blue dust in its wake. The light dims quickly, but for a moment there was a brilliant flash that illuminated the sky just as if the sun had suddenly risen in the middle of the night.

> As the shooting star disappeared from sight, so too did the dazzling blue light that illuminated the sky. A soft woosh sound could be heard, followed by a faint patter. Then, as if by miracle of the night, tiny specks of glowing blue dust sprinkled the ground. The star fragments were too small and delicate to be held carelessly, but were nonetheless beautiful to behold in their own right. The soft glow that emanated from them seemed to dance in the wind and disappear as quickly as it came.`;
